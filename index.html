      Where do I Job?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I job at <a href="https://parqueexplora.org"> Parque Explora</a> a Science Centre (Museum). There, I have been doing many different things, such as teaching robotics to boys in far towns from the city, writing for the museum exhibitions. (I even wrote a comic about The Panama Canal- I really enjoyed that), designing electronics systems for the exhibit, writing code for exhibits software, or leadearing the development of technology in different projects. I don´t know what I will be doing there tomorrow.
